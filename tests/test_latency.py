                CHIEF COMPLAINT:
                Patient presents with recurring severe headaches occurring 4-5 times per week
                over the past 2 months. Pain intensity ranges from 7-9 out of 10 on numeric scale.
                Episodes typically last 3-6 hours and significantly impact daily activities.
                
                HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
                Headaches began approximately 8 weeks ago following increased work stress.
                Pain is described as throbbing, primarily frontal and temporal regions.
                Associated symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and severe photophobia.
                Patient reports no relief with over-the-counter medications including
                acetaminophen 1000mg or ibuprofen 800mg. Symptoms worsen with physical activity.
                
                PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
                - Hypertension diagnosed 2015, well controlled on medication

                - No history of migraines or severe headaches prior to current episode
                - No history of head trauma or neurological conditions
                
                MEDICATIONS:
                1. Metformin 1000mg twice daily for diabetes management
                2. Lisinopril 20mg once daily for hypertension control  
                3. Levothyroxine 100mcg once daily for hypothyroidism
                4. No current pain medications or migraine prophylaxis
                
                ALLERGIES:
                No known drug allergies. No food allergies reported.
                
                SOCIAL HISTORY:
                Non-smoker. Occasional alcohol use (1-2 drinks per week).
                Works as software engineer with high stress demands.
                Regular exercise routine disrupted by headache symptoms.
                
                FAMILY HISTORY:
                Mother: migraines, hypertension, died age 67 from stroke
                Father: diabetes, coronary artery disease, alive age 72
                Sister: no significant medical history
                Maternal grandmother: severe migraines throughout life
                
                REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
                Constitutional: No fever, chills, or weight loss
                Neurological: Severe headaches as described, no seizures, weakness, or numbness
                Cardiovascular: No chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath
                Gastrointestinal: Nausea and vomiting associated with headaches only
                Endocrine: Known diabetes and hypothyroidism, otherwise negative
                
                PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
                Vital Signs: BP 128/82, HR 74, RR 16, Temp 98.6Â°F, O2 Sat 98%
                General: Alert, oriented, appears uncomfortable but not in acute distress
                HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic, pupils equal and reactive
                Neck: Supple, no lymphadenopathy, no carotid bruits
                Neurological: Cranial nerves II-XII intact, motor and sensory exam normal
                
                ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
                1. New onset frequent severe headaches, likely migraine without aura
                2. Consider secondary causes given age of onset and frequency
                3. Initiate migraine prophylaxis with topiramate 25mg daily
                4. Provide sumatriptan 50mg for acute treatment, max 9 doses per month
                5. Order brain MRI to rule out secondary causes
                6. Lifestyle modifications: regular sleep, stress management, dietary triggers
                7. Follow-up in 4 weeks to assess treatment response
                8. Return precautions: worsening symptoms, neurological changes
