### Your Visit Summary - November 15th 

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 

Here's what we discussed about your headaches today:

**WHAT YOU TOLD US**
You've been dealing with really severe headaches for about 3 weeks now [S1]. These aren't just regular headaches - you described the pain as about 7-8 out of 10, which is pretty intense [S2]. They're happening every day and mostly on the right side of your head with that throbbing feeling [S3].

You mentioned that bright lights make things worse and you sometimes feel nauseous [S6], which are classic signs that help us understand what's going on. The regular pain medications you tried at home (like ibuprofen and Tylenol) just weren't cutting it [S7].

**WHAT WE FIGURED OUT**
The good news is that your physical exam looked completely normal [S11][S12], which is reassuring. Based on everything you told us and what we observed, these headaches fit the pattern of migraines. The timing with the extra stress at work [S5] makes a lot of sense - stress is one of the most common migraine triggers.

**YOUR NEW TREATMENT PLAN**

ðŸ©º **Medication**: We're giving you sumatriptan (50mg tablets) to take when a migraine starts [S14]. This is specifically designed for migraines and works differently than regular pain medications. Take one at the first sign of a headache - don't wait for it to get worse!

**Important**: Only take up to 2 tablets in 24 hours, and try not to use them more than 2-3 times per week to avoid rebound headaches.

ðŸŒŸ **Lifestyle Changes**: 
- **Stress management**: This is huge for you! Consider techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or regular walks [S15]
- **Sleep routine**: Try to get 7-8 hours nightly and go to bed at the same time
- **Stay hydrated**: Dehydration can trigger migraines
- **Regular meals**: Don't skip meals, as low blood sugar can be a trigger

**WHAT TO WATCH FOR**
Most people start seeing improvement within 2-3 weeks of starting treatment and making lifestyle changes. However, contact us right away if you experience:
- Fever with your headache
- Any weakness, numbness, or vision changes
- Headaches that are suddenly much worse than before
- Any concerns about your new medication

**NEXT STEPS**
We want to see you back in 4 weeks [S16] to check on how you're doing with the new treatment. If things aren't improving by then, we have other options to try.

**REMEMBER**
Migraines are very treatable! Many people find significant relief once we identify the right approach for them. You're taking the right steps by getting treatment early. 

Questions between now and your next visit? Don't hesitate to call or message us through the patient portal.

Take care! ðŸ’™

## Design Analysis & Explanation

### **Clinician Summary Design Principles**

**Structure & Format**:
- **Medical terminology**: Uses precise clinical language ("migraine without aura", "intracranial pressure")
- **Standardized sections**: Follows traditional SOAP-like format familiar to healthcare providers
- **Concise bullets**: Information condensed for rapid scanning during busy clinical workflows
- **Assessment/Plan separation**: Clear distinction between diagnosis and treatment decisions
- **Documentation focus**: Includes details needed for medical-legal documentation and billing

**Language Characteristics**:
- **Objective tone**: Professional, neutral language
- **Medical precision**: Specific dosages, frequencies, and clinical parameters
- **Risk mitigation**: Explicit mention of red flags and return precautions
- **Billing-ready**: Includes elements that support coding and reimbursement

**Target Audience Needs**:
- **Time-pressed clinicians**: Information structured for 30-second review
- **Clinical decision-making**: Emphasizes differential diagnosis and evidence-based treatment
- **Continuity of care**: Other providers can quickly understand case and continue treatment
- **Legal documentation**: Comprehensive enough for medical record standards

### **Patient Summary Design Principles**

**Structure & Format**:
- **Conversational flow**: Organized like a friendly explanation rather than clinical documentation
- **Visual elements**: Emojis and formatting to make content engaging and less intimidating
- **Action-oriented sections**: Clear "what to do" guidance throughout
- **Reassurance integration**: Positive framing and encouragement woven into medical information

**Language Characteristics**:
- **Plain language**: Medical terms explained or replaced with accessible alternatives
- **Personal pronouns**: "You", "your", "we" to create collaborative feeling
- **Supportive tone**: Encouraging, understanding, and empowering language
- **Concrete examples**: Specific instructions rather than general medical advice

**Target Audience Needs**:
- **Health literacy**: Information accessible regardless of medical background
- **Anxiety reduction**: Reassuring tone to address common patient fears
- **Self-advocacy**: Empowers patients to participate in their care
- **Practical guidance**: Actionable steps they can implement immediately

### **Shared Elements & Consistency**

**Provenance Tracking**:
- Both summaries reference identical source points [S1], [S2], etc.
- Ensures medical-legal traceability across different audience versions
- Maintains accuracy and consistency of core medical facts

**Essential Medical Information**:
- Same diagnosis, treatment plan, and follow-up requirements
- Consistent medication dosing and safety information
- Identical return precautions and warning signs

**Quality Assurance**:
- Both versions require clinician approval before patient access
- Regular audit of language appropriateness for each audience
- Feedback loops to improve clarity and effectiveness

### **Implementation Considerations**

**Technology Requirements**:
- Template system that maintains provenance links across versions
- Natural language processing to ensure appropriate tone and complexity
- Integration with EHR systems for seamless clinical workflow

**Clinical Workflow**:
- Clinician reviews and approves both versions
- Patient access delayed until clinician approval
- Easy editing capability for personalization

**Measuring Success**:
- Patient satisfaction scores for summary clarity and usefulness
- Clinician efficiency metrics for documentation review time
- Patient adherence to treatment plans and follow-up appointments
- Reduction in post-visit clarification calls

This dual-summary approach recognizes that the same medical information serves different purposes for different audiences, optimizing both clinical efficiency and patient engagement while maintaining the highest standards of accuracy and safety.
